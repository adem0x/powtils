Known Bug on BSD:
  DSO (dynpwu.pas) will not work on BSD but works fine on Linux 
  (date tested: Jan-Feb 2007). Reported BSD bug relating to dynamic link 
   libraries to the FPC team, assigned to Marco V.

Known Bug on Unix:
  Smartlinking will not work on FPC 2.0.2 for the DSO/DLL.  Smartlinking 
  appears to work fine on MS Windows for dynamic link libraries. If compiling 
  the DSO/DLL on unix, turn smart linking off.  The problem was related to 
  finalization/initialization not occuring.

Known bug: 

 FPC 2.0.4 sockets Win32 was causing I/O errors through TCP/IP
 http.pp, smtp.pp, httptest.pp,  smtptest.pp are directly unmodified from
 the pascal server pages project and used to crash on Win32.
 
 We have found the issue that is causing this! We have reported this bug
 to the fpc team and as far as tested, is fixed in FPC 2.2.0.
