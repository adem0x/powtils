SimpleWiki SYNTAX for editing pages is as follows:
<pre>
  horizontal rule:  ---

  heading:    ==heading2==
             ===heading3===
            ====heading4====
          

  bold:    b[some text]b
  
  italic:  i[some text]i

  link:    http://url.com
           ftp://url.com
           https://url.com
           [[http://url.com anchor text]]

  code:    - - c o d e
           for i:= 1 to 5 do
             writeln;
           c o d e - -
  
  HTML:    you can also add HTML anywhere! No requirements, just insert the html as 
           normal. This way if the wiki syntax limits you, then you can still use 
           HTML. On public servers you may wish to add a feature to disable java 
           tags for security, and also html/head/body tags.  

 FUTURE CONSIDERATION

  custom:   custom[some tag of yours]custom
            anything[something inside]anything
              
            These could act like macros which end up calling real html specified
            in some INI file (and the INI file could be edited in this web program 
            too, so that changes could be made to the macros online instantly).
