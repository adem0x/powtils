Known Bug on BSD:
  DSO (dynpwu) will not work on BSD but works fine on Linux 
  (date tested: Jan-Feb 2007). Reported BSD bug relating to dynamic link 
   libraries to the FPC team, assigned to Marco V.

Known Bug on Unix:
  smartlinking will not work on FPC 2.0.2 for the PWU DSO/DLL.
  smartlinking appears to work fine on Microsoft Windows for dynamic link
  libraries. If compiling the DSO/DLL on unix, turn smart linking off.
  The problem was related to finalization/initialization not occuring in the
  DSO.

Known bug: 

 FPC 2.0.4 sockets Win32 was causing I/O errors through TCP/IP
 http.pp, smtp.pp, httptest.pp,  smtptest.pp are directly unmodified from
 the pascal server pages project and used to crash on Win32.
 
 We have found the issue that is causing this! We have reported this bug
 to the fpc team and as far as tested, is fixed in FPC 2.2.0.
